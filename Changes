Revision history for Perl extension Time::LST.
#--------------------------------------------

#---
0.037 Sept 2009 : continuing effort to make cross-platform friendly dist

0.03  Sat Dec 30 2006
	- now able to make use of "08" for a month or day, which some module 
	  croaked on otherwise
      - handles Feb 29 for 1970 and 2037
	- further cleanup of POD/man

#---
0.02  Fri Dec 08 2006
	- error corrected in conversion fn: use gmtime not localtime (thanks to Astro::Time author for pointing it out)
	- conversion re-written to directly use core methods of Astro::Time, not its internal wrappers
	- now_2_lst() method: added - simple route to what time is above your head, counting the stars
	- ymdhms_2_lst(): third argument for timezone added - note it is CASE SENSITIVE for now:
		we need to quickly distinguish between Sudan/Regional_city and SUDAN and so on ...
		So ymdhms_2_lst() presently permits and restricts parsing of timezone by: 
			(i) Date::Parse (3-character (capital letter) format); or
			(ii) DateTime ([C|c]ountry/locale string).
